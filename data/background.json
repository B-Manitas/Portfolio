The data had to be extracted, standardized, and stored in a database for further analysis.\n- **Data Analysis**: Subsequently, data analysis was performed to track each user's daily usage. This analysis is available through daily reports emailed to lab managers and on a dedicated website.\n- **Website Restoration**: Another responsibility was to restore the functionality of a website using the Django framework. The site code was reorganized using the Model-View-Controller pattern to improve code structure and maintainability.\n- **SQL Query Optimization**: It was also necessary to redesign the SQL queries used for data storage to make them more efficient and facilitate code maintenance.",

This algorithm handles data complexity and noise effectively, enabling relevant grouping of incidents.\n4. **Integration of Topological Data**  \nTo improve model accuracy, substation topology data was integrated. **Node2Vec** embedding was used to convert these data into a format usable by the clustering model.\n5. **Performance Evaluation**  \nFinally, the model's performance was evaluated and compared with existing solutions, measuring its accuracy in identifying affected substations.",
