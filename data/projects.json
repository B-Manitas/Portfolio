Physics-based approach:** Direct analysis of the time series using **SciPy** to extract features such as peaks, frequencies, and repetitions, allowing precise identification of movement patterns.\n\n**2. Deep learning approach:** Development of **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** using **TensorFlow** to automatically detect patterns and classify exercise repetitions from the sensor data.\n\nThe workflow also involved **data preprocessing** with **NumPy and Pandas**, handling missing values, normalization, and synchronization of multivariate signals. Experiments were conducted on **Google Cloud Platform virtual machines** for computational efficiency, and all work was version-controlled with **Git**.\n\nThis project demonstrates a combination of **data-driven AI methods** and **physics-based analysis** to provide accurate and interpretable insights into exercise performance."

If it has more than three neighbors, it dies due to overpopulation. If a cell is dead and has exactly three neighbors, it comes to life, creating a new cell.\n\nThe user can interact with the simulation by clicking on the cells to change their state, allowing the creation of specific patterns. Additionally, the user can adjust the initial probability of living cells to customize the simulation further.",
